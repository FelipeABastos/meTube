# meTube

meTube is an app wich uses the youtube (search API) to find videos based on what user wants to search. Feel free to use, just a quick advice: The API Key have a limited use capacity (quote = 10.000 defaulted by google), so if you exceed this limit, the API will stop working by the rest of the day, you can adquire your own key on Google's credentials page :) Enjoy the app!
